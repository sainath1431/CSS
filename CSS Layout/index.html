        Introduction to CSS layout: 
        -It is a very important part of web design which alllows the deveoper to position the lelments on a webpage so that web page can be visually appealing and user friendly.

        -In other words, we can say that it is a process of using css to control the position and size of elements on a webpages.

        Benefits of using CSS layouts:
        i] Better presentation and structure.
        ii] Better accessibility.
        iii] Flexible and responsive.
        iv] Reusability 
        v] Browser compatibility.

        Types of CSS layouts:

        i]Normal flow
        ii]float
        iii] Position
        iv] flex.
        v] Grid.


        Normal  flow: it is the defaoult layout model in whch elements are rendered in the order they are written in the HTML file.
                        it is the default and simplest layout model.

    `   Float : 
        
        Float property specifies how we can position an element within the container.
        float is majorly used when we want to align element horizontally next to each other.
        These are most used properties of float to position the elements : 
        1)none
        2) left
        3) right

        none : This is the default property set on the element which means that the element will not float anywhere  and will be there a according to the normal document flow.

        Left : This property will float (position) the element to the left side of the container, instead of positioning the element with the default layout flow.

        right : This property will float (position ) the element to the right side of the container, instead of positioning the element with the default layout flow.
