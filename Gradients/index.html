        It is defined bt its center.
        To create a radial gradient you must also define at least two color stops.
        By default , shape is ellipse, size is the farthest-corner, and position is centre.*/

        /* background-image: conic-gradient(red 210deg, yellow, black); here starts with red and area of degree of red is defined 210 degree so that much area is occupied by red and then remaining area is adjusted by blck and yellow equally. */
